This program takes an input file and calculates each student's grade for a class based on the weights of various tests and quizzes. An output file containing each student's name (sorted by first name), along with their grade for the class is created.

This was the final project for the online Java Programming for Beginners class with UCSC Extension. There is also separate repository containing a similar program written in C.
